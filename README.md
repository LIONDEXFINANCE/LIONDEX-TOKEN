# LIONDEX-TOKEN
BEP20 COMPLIANCE.

Liondex DEFI aims to build a decentralized exchange (DEX) to run on the binance smart chain, where users are allowed to stake assets that represent any token and earn BNB as a profit for each token they stake.

Liondex will be a solution that makes use of innovative features and secure locking, offering additional liquidity options.
It will make multi-asset pools accessible to those who want to offer multi-asset trades.
The purpose of all this is to provide stable and predictable trading for users, with front running system protection.

# In addition, Liondex will begin trading in tokenized stocks of major corporations such as Google and others after launching the full exchange. 

Our investors will earn up to 30% APY or ~2.5% monthly profits of token value by just simply holding LDEX tokens.

Funds raised from the crowd-sale will be used to provide liquidity solutions for the Injective.
